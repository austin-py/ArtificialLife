LEFT TO DO
==========================
1. Change mutation types (In random_solution.py)
3. Figure out seeding 
3. Fix IDs so we can change bodies too... relates to seeding. 




Current Problem: 
- When I get to second gen the fitness drops significantly and doesn't ever rebound, like basically just doesn't move at all....
