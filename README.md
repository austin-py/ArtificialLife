=======================
These snakes are randomly generated with the following parameters: 
  - Number of Boxes: 2 - 11 
  - Probability of Sensor: 50% 
  - Probability of Motor: 100% 
  - Height: 0.01 - 1.01 
  - Depth: 0.01 - 1.01 
  - Width: 0.01 - 2.01 
  
  They were made to only move backwards away from the viewer on a 1D plane for now. 


TO RUN: 
===================
Simply run "python3 main.py" and it will simulate 10 snakes for 100 frames each. For some reason it changes the view on snakes 2-10, but these can be slowed down and played with using the constants.py
